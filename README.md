# azuredatafactory

This project gets covid-19 data from the ECDC website using azure data factory in two ways. The first way is by uploading the data directly into the Azure Blob Storage and then making the subsequent modifications, the second way is using http conector as a linked service. The data is, then, saved into azure data lake.
